# Lab Enhancement - Keras with MNist

## Provided by Wan Muhammad Atif bin Taram Satiraksa (1211103154)

In this lab enhancement, a neural network was built using Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The lab introduced key neural network concepts, including layers, activation functions, and training mechanisms.

A real-world analogy was used to visualise the process, making it easier to understand how the network adjusts its parameters over time.

The implementation involved preparing the dataset, designing a model with an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer, and then training it using an optimization algorithm. The model improved its accuracy over multiple training cycles and was evaluated on test data, achieving strong performance. A randomised sample prediction was performed to verify that the network correctly classified a digit.

At the end I provided additional exercises that involves tuning the hyperparameters to replacing MNist with Fashion MNist dataset.
