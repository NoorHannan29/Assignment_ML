# Lab Enhancement - Linear Regression

## Provided by ADAM DANIEL BIN SAIFUL AZLY (1211104378)

For the final lab enhancement for this Group 20, it will be focusing on Linear Regression, a basic algorithm in machine learning under the category of Supervised Machine Learning algorithm. This lab introduced key linear regression concept,including the relation between dependent and independent variables, the loss function, and optimization techniques like gradeint function.

A real-world applications can be used to build relationship between variables and dee if there is any correlations, see what kind of relationship that it have, and what are the effects on each of it that can be beneficial to us.

The implementation involved preparing the dataset by cleaning and normalizing the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and then appplying the gradient descent algorithm to optimize the model parameters. The model's performance was evaluated on test data by calculating the mean squared error, and visualization were geberated to show the regression line fitting the actual data points.

I provided a step-by-step guide on how to perform Simple, Multiple and Polynomial Linear Regression that involves with a few types of domain based on different types of dataset.
