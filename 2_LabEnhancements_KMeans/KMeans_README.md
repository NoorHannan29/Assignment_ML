# Lab Enhancement - KMeans

## Provided by Noor Hannan Bin Noor Hamsuruddin (1211104293)

In this lab enhancement, Kmeans clustering is applied to a data set. After importing the dataset andd doing some preprocessing on that dataset.

Next, a sample is created from the dataset, and is the displayed in a scatter plot without clustering.

Then, the KMeans clustering package is imported, a model with 3 clusters is createdd, then fitted onto the dataset. The KMeans sorted dataset is then displayed into a new scatter plot, with the dataset clustered into suitable groups.

Additionally, the KneeLocator is imported and used to identify the ideal number of clusters to be used in the kmeans clustering function. Multiple kmeans cluster graphs are displayed, an elbow graph is also plotted to visualise the sum of squared distances against number of clusters, where the ideal number of cluster can be clearly displayed.

Lastly, with the ideal number of clusters, the KMeans scatter plot is displayed once more.
