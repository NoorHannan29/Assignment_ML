# Lab Enhancement - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Provided by Khoo Jen-Au (1211102910)

In this Lab Enhancement, I explained what PCA is using an analogy of a real life scenario. Then I talked about the importance of it, and applications of PCA in modelling. Then I went through the process of exploring a dataset about abalones, and in the Abalone dataset are physical measurements taken from several thousand Tasmanian abalone.

The dataset has 9 columns, 1 categorical, 7 numerical columns, and 1 target column. It has no missing values, however the values have a significant variation in measurements, so standardisation is required before performing PCA.

Once the preprocessing process is over, which included the process of encoding the "Type" (Gender) of the abalone, as well as the standaridised numerical features, PCA is then performed.

With the results of the PCA process, I explained the cumulative explained variance, as well as some insights of the PCA process. After that, I choose the number of components.

After that, I mentioned some potential uses with PCA, which included feature engineering, and potential future work.
